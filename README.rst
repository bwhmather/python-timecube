Installation
------------
.. begin-installation

The God words you know, will not allow you to know TIME CUBE's Highest Life
Order.

Only by comprehending the Divinity of Cubic Creation and invoking:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install timecube

will your soul be saved from your created hell on Earth - induced by your
ignoring the existing 4 corner harmonic simultaneous 4 Days rotating in a
single cycle of the Earth sphere.

.. end-installation

-----
.. begin-usage

YOU pitiful mindless fools, YOU are educated stupid.

.. code:: python

    >>> import timecube
    >>> timecube.sentence()
    '3-Dimensional math as in length, width and height are erroneous when applied within a Cube like room for they do not account for the 4-corner perspective dimensions of difference as in "4-dimensional space".'
